# GPU Image Filters

This is a learning project where I implement image filters in C++ on CPU and GPU.

Milestones:
-M1: C++ basics (loops, functions, vectors)
-M2: 2D arrays and threshold filter
-M3: Load real images and convert to grayscale
-M4: CPU filters (blur, edge detection)
-M5: GPU filters (CUDA)
